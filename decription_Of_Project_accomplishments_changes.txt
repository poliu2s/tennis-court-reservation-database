What we accomplished:


the project that we created is the badminton court rental system
this system will allow users who are using the court to book a time for court at certain time, able to 
apply for the course that runs by court staff, and able to cancel book time, and courses. staffs(coaches) will have their own access to book a time for a court
and teach student in courses provided. each coaches and students(users) will have their own skill level, and coaches and students are matched according to those 
skill level. system allows users to pay, and access to their transaction, and their transaction for their refunds for canceling for their book time.
system manages all courts, transaction, and all courses.


Different from formal specification

Also, due to difficulties with getting our database to work, we had to remove the functionality for waitlisting. 
We also removed the manager functionality, as we felt this did not fit the rest of the application we had (manager should have different app)


Differences in final schema:

1. Web Viewer entity is removed
2. Views relationship removed
3. User_TransactionList entity added
4. some transaction_id attribute removed from entity that contains it and replaced with transactionList_id
5. Based_On relationship removed
6. foreign key added for transactionList entity
7. Account holder has been modified to appUser

Reasons for change in schema: to resolve the problem related to foreign keys + and having too many arrows led to complex diagram, therefore needed to simplify schema
